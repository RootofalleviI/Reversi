Dear instructor:

tl;dr: 	Please go to folder "WithComments" and read files there.

Full:
	The files in the root directory (aka here) are written 
	very concisely and may not be easily understood. Since
	Q4 is quite long and there are many different ways to
	solve the problem (which makes your hand-marking process
	a great pain), I have provided an extra version of my 
	assignment that has a lot of debugging functions, that
	hopefully can help you understand my implementation
	faster and make the process less painful. 

	To see how the algorithm works, uncomment the line
	"#define DEBUG" in every file, re-compile, and run the
	executable. There should be enough information printed
	on the screen (along with the comments in the source
	file) to save you some time understanding my code.

Thank you and have a nice day!

David
